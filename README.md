# Customer-Segmentation
I created a baisc customer segmenation model using K-Means clustring. It involves:
**Visualization**: Created visualization plots to identify the correlated variables and outliers in the data.
**Cleaning**: Cleaned the data by removing outliers and unnecessary columns.
**Standarization**: Standarized the data so the model treat all the variables equally.
**K-Means**: Used KMeans model to fit the data. Set number of clusters to 5 as viewed in visualizations. Created a Cluster column which had cluster number of every point in the data belonging to their nearest cluster. Used interia_ to obtain the optimal number of clusters.
